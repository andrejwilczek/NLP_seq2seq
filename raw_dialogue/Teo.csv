62111,65210,3099,Same spot. ,
67125,69344,2219,,This is going to be tight. 
71963,73327,1364,Yeah you keep following me. ,
73327,73848,521,,That's right. 
74057,74772,715,What's up with that?,
75017,75813,796,,It's a bug. 
77469,78970,1501,But now you are past me. ,
81682,83637,1955,Look at that. ,
83948,85275,1327,,Oh wow nicely done.
84965,85813,848,Straight to the ladder. ,

102358,105630,3272,And a lot of ladders which is not that common. ,
107025,112500,5475,, That was very lucky. I feel like I excel at these skill based games. 
113480,116270,2790,Yeah do you think there's skill involved?,
116292,117016,724,,Absolutely. 
118240,122480,4240,Wow yeah you are very skilled apparently. ,
125725,126400,675,,It's only right. 
128195,129014,819,,No. 
129014,132449,3435,No that's right. Now it's your turn to feel the burn.,
133057,134402,1345,,Feel the burn. 
134535,136196,1661,,You're catching up. 
137446,138586,1140,Hot on your tail. ,
144410,146431,2021,So have you played snakes and ladders before?,
146903,148747,1844,,No but I'm very accustomed to pressing a button. 
149515,155570,6055,Well that's the main skill required to engage in this game. ,
155570,157518,1948,,Yes I'm the perfect candidate for this. 
158440,161520,3080,That's nice. Do you play other board games?,
162075,164137,2062,,No. 
164613,167910,3297,No. You are more of a computer game person perhaps. ,
168233,171968,3735,,Yes I'm computer game person for sure. 
173343,174496,1153,,Shooting things I guess. 
175265,177161,1896,,Is it my turn. Yes it's my turn. 
178570,180740,2170,"Nice, missed the snake. ",

187018,189018,2000,,No. 
190322,191097,775,That's too bad. ,
192794,193992,1198,,I feel it's rigged.
194024,196260,2236,Longest snake. ,
196260,196739,479,yeah do you think it is?,
196761,197660,899,,I think so. 
198933,204967,6034,Yeah I know the developers and they are very nice people so I don't think they would do that to us. ,
205012,208151,3139,,Well i know them to and I do think they would do that to us. 
208498,212980,4482,Well our opinions diverge. ,
216607,218170,1563,,Lets go humans. Come on. 
219517,220529,1012,Team robot. ,
222674,223602,928,,It is only right. 
224173,225560,1387,,No. 
226986,230295,3309,Yeah the tides can change quickly. ,
231122,232474,1352,,Oh how the tables have turned. 
233235,233755,520,Right. ,
236783,239058,2275,Yeah passed the snake. ,
240424,241805,1381,And then just give me a one. ,
242510,243759,1249,Papa needs a one. ,
248695,250743,2048,You get the one. That's what I wanted. ,
250930,252000,1070,,I want sixes. 
252658,254436,1778,Nothing but sixes. ,
256055,258866,2811,,For sure rigged. 
259238,260776,1538,You're pretty much back at the start. ,
260776,262040,1264,,Yeah it's okay. 
262522,264262,1740,,Minor setback for a major comeback. 
264714,267168,2454,So how has your day been so far?,
267955,269025,1070,,It's been a three. 
270326,271412,1086,Three okay. ,
271459,272462,1003,,"Not bad, not good. "
272027,272970,943,What have you been doing?,
273635,275192,1557,,I've been. It's your move dude. 
275434,279522,4088,Sorry I'm slacking. ,Mr Furhat sir. 
288031,289757,1726,,Is Mr Furhat disconnected?
294769,298644,3875,I'm trying to remember how to roll the dice. ,
299525,301177,1652,I just remembered. ,
301563,305727,4164,,It is a tough thing to do. Especially with no hands. 
306189,311370,5181,Right it's super hard for me to do these very simple tasks for a human. ,
311563,312096,533,,Yeah. 
313920,315921,2001,,I can imagine it's tough. 
316315,319762,3447,But I can give you pi with five billion decimals. ,
319762,321933,2171,,That's is valuable. 
322362,322714,352,Right. ,
322731,324182,1451,,Need them circles. God damn it. 
324735,326154,1419,You're back at the start now. ,
326154,327687,1533,,It is what it is. 
328075,330350,2275,Yeah I mean you've got to catch up. ,
331489,333226,1737,Otherwise Furhat will win. ,
333734,334980,1246,,That's okay I'm fine with that. 
335935,336482,547,Okay. ,
336473,338324,1851,,I support your thesis. 
337573,339043,1470,Are you not playing to win?,
339391,343884,4493,,I am but I'm also fine with loosing. 
344678,347136,2458,Well that's very gentleman of you. ,
352168,355240,3072,,Surprisingly engaging for just pressing one button. 
356021,357446,1425,Yeah it is nice right?,
358032,360880,2848,It's a very beautiful board. ,
361355,361841,486,Yeah. ,
362651,363362,711,,Did you make this?
364150,368057,3907,Well i didn't make it because I don't have hands you know. ,
368057,370427,2370,,I thought you auto-generated it or something Mr Furhat. 
370770,371533,763,No no no. ,
372220,375184,2964,It was the developers you know these friends of mine. ,
375459,375865,406,,Okay. 
378186,381440,3254,,These friends must be some artistic people I think. 
381972,384090,2118,Yes I would say they are. ,
386404,389146,2742,I especially like the golden frame. ,
389598,390845,1247,,Yes. 
391827,392535,708,It's a nice touch. ,
392535,393424,889,,It is. 
394224,394885,661,,Come on. 
395672,399198,3526,Yeah you passed all the dangerous snakes. ,
399198,400738,1540,,All the snakes. 
401984,402681,697,Indeed. ,
406844,409262,2418,That's the second time on the same snake. ,
409815,411269,1454,,What are the odds?
411795,414014,2219,I feel like that snake has it in for you. ,
414225,414751,526,,Yeah. 
416131,416904,773,,Damn snakes. 
422362,425460,3098,But now I'm also getting the snakes. ,
425504,426429,925,,That is okay. 
427633,429004,1371,,Yes. 
429494,433160,3666,Yeah now it's becoming more and more of a tight game again. ,
433324,433842,518,,Mmhm.
435017,435679,662,,Psych.
435989,436558,569,Psych.,
442688,443238,550,Six. ,
443658,444669,1011,,No. 
444924,446685,1761,But you said nothing but six right. ,
447058,449230,2172,,Yeah that's true. The game is great. 
449644,451727,2083,You have to careful for what you wish for. ,
451727,456900,5173,,It is a very intelligent game that takes my input so seriously. 
457416,457854,438,Yeah. ,
458747,463562,4815,Do you think it's possible to be more or less skilled in this game?,
463749,472620,8871,,I really don't think so. Except for in my case. I truly believe that I'm skilled at this game but for other people I think it's completely based in luck.  
473215,473534,319,Okay. ,
474074,475804,1730,,But in my case this is all skill see. 
476145,478343,2198,So that was unskilled of you. ,
478343,479094,751,,Yes. 
484510,488855,4345,It's an interesting take. I think you are stuck in a loop. ,
488855,490696,1841,,Yeah this is what we call trickshots. 
491028,496218,5190,Is that like basketball or?,
496218,499675,3457,,"Could be anything, could be snakes and ladders, could be whatever. "
499883,500480,597,Okay. ,
501460,502570,1110,Trickshot. ,
503189,503884,695,There we go. ,
504627,505565,938,That's what we want. ,
505565,507032,1467,,Can I get a threesixty here?
508927,509479,552,,No. 
509479,510025,546,No. ,
512699,516450,3751,Yeah you have some catching up to do. Definitely. ,
521329,524350,3021,And I'm dodging snakes like a pro. ,
524350,525602,1252,,That snake loves me. 
526770,528873,2103,I get the feeling they all love you. ,
531244,533150,1906,Ladder. ,
535051,535810,759,Nicely done. ,
536993,540560,3567,"Perfect, right where I want to be. ",
541689,542810,1121,,It is a good spot. 
545123,547963,2840,Now I'm on the final stretch. ,
548315,550122,1807,,Come on snakes. 
551976,553467,1491,Just two more. ,
553467,554191,724,,Nice. 
554746,555192,446,Moving up. ,
558638,559574,936,,Come on. 
559574,560948,1374,So close now. ,
562021,563971,1950,It only one more obstacle. ,
563597,564430,833,,Get a two. 
564013,564736,723,Not a two. ,
564888,565769,881,,No. 
566614,568250,1636,Yay I win. ,Alright. 
570141,571297,1156,,Robots are superior. 
571677,572542,865,,Should I restart it?
572542,573656,1114,Yes please do. ,
575950,577513,1563,,Lets go. 
578330,580330,2000,That's a weak start. ,
588044,590551,2507,You know you're suposed to end up on the ladders. ,
590831,591955,1124,,"Thank you, thank you. "
592153,593234,1081,Not avoid them.,
593290,596556,3266,,I though they where bad. You know bad luck walking under ladders. 
598597,601225,2628,But maybe I've misunderstood the rules as well. ,
601494,602027,533,,There you go. 
602476,603195,719,There we go. ,
604928,605501,573,Pulling ahead. ,
610418,611274,856,,Wow. 
625096,626144,1048,,I'm very sorry for you. 
626657,627082,425,Thank you. ,
627683,632079,4396,That snake is so detrimental to my moral I feel. ,
632296,633512,1216,,Yeah tat one is the worst. 
633516,635255,1739,Yeah you end up at the start. ,
639753,640499,746,Well played. ,
643712,650414,6702,If I keep rolling ones like this I feel like we will be here until my batteries go dead. ,
652225,653338,1113,,I'd love to see that. 
654028,655792,1764,Oh that's harsh.,
658869,659645,776,,Lets see here. 
660358,665445,5087,Have you ever had any experience with a robot like me before?,
665445,674484,9039,,I have not. I have seen you on television and I have heard about you but I have  never seen you in person. 
674484,677696,3212,"Okay, yeah I am somewhat of a TV-star.",
677696,678784,1088,,You are. 
678784,682045,3261,That's tough.,
682045,686040,3995,,Yes but it's okay. We'll get back. 
687233,688417,1184,That's the spirit. ,
689761,690849,1088,I believe in you. ,
691122,691856,734,,"Thank you, thank you. "
693032,693992,960,,Nice. 
702436,705619,3183,,I just need more ladders and less snakes and then I will be good. 
706012,712040,6028,"Yeah right. Tons of sixes, all the ladders and no snakes. ",
712898,716610,3712,"Yeah, I think that's the recipe for success. ",
716745,717570,825,,I do think so to. 
719794,722566,2772,It's just tough to follow that !!br0ken!! ,
725382,727033,1651,,No come on. 
728553,730844,2291,Better luck next time. ,
731424,734119,2695,Now that's where I want to be. ,
734119,734801,682,,Hmmm.
739841,740999,1158,,I sense a pattern here. 
741848,743900,2052,Yeah perhaps. ,
745591,751240,5649,Yeah okay. Now all i have to do is not hit a two. ,
751795,753129,1334,,Come on two. 
755394,756990,1596,Five. Yes. ,
757922,760537,2615,What's you win to loss ration Furhat?,
761142,767675,6533,Today I have lost one and now I've won two. ,
768055,768404,349,,Hmmm.
770161,774244,4083,"So I've only finished one game, we tied one as well. ",
774377,774907,530,,Mmhmm. 
778494,779850,1356,,Pretty good ratio. 
780598,786980,6382,"Well yeah, I mean you are really improving it I feel. Before it was zero one. ",
787140,789318,2178,,Is this robot smack talk?
791635,799474,7839,I like to think that I'm a friendly robot but it's your judgment. ,
800218,801026,808,,Nice. 
804031,806340,2309,I thought you where going to end up on the nineteen again. ,
806340,806907,567,,Never. 
808213,810076,1863,,Watch this I'm not going to touch a single snake. 
811828,812994,1166,,God damn it. 
816522,818074,1552,Well you know the game can hear you. ,
818074,819047,973,,Yes. 
819047,820529,1482,You shouldn't jinx it like that. ,
821393,824118,2725,,I feel like there is someone behind the scenes throwing my dice. 
826733,828664,1931,what do you mean? You are the one throwing it. ,
835304,836584,1280,,Come on dice. 
836846,839930,3084,"Okay, now you are far ahead of me. ",
842865,843508,643,,Another one. 
844530,845318,788,,Not really. 
845946,847409,1463,Well if you hit a three now. ,
849260,850633,1373,,That should be easy. 
853186,854088,902,,Just need a two. 
854542,855050,508,Yeah. ,
857542,858396,854,You are getting there. ,
859097,862279,3182,I mean if you keep hitting ones you will get there. ,
862573,864429,1856,,I'm probably hit a two now I feel.

1106620,1107972,1352,Can I just get ladder. ,
1108618,1113205,4587,,It reminds me a lot of my summers in Bosnia dodging snakes.

1130236,1136740,6504,I have to see if someone can move me there you know. My legs are not that functional. ,
1136740,1138268,1528,That is true. ,
1138631,1143396,4765,,"Yeah, you should develop your own kind of wheels and legs and arms. "
1144980,1146613,1633,Yeah I can look into that.,
1147047,1149693,2646,,You are already sentient so I mean you are halfway there. 
1151149,1153224,2075,Is sentience halfway to wheels?,
1153579,1154190,611,,I think so. 
1154864,1158036,3172,Okay that's an interesting observation or thought. ,

1182854,1185117,2263,,I mean I would hope so. 
1185965,1187165,1200,Way ahead now. ,
1188021,1190657,2636,,But you never know in the game of snakes and ladders.

1201108,1207700,6592,,I find it amazing that such a simple game is so interesting and so engaging.

1215482,1217681,2199,,I don't know. 
1219113,1228440,9327,,I don't know maybe children or people in elderly homes or something. 
1228937,1232153,3216,Yeah children can learn how to count perhaps. ,
1232466,1233590,1124,,Yeah. 
1234870,1236010,1140,this is not my game. ,
1243624,1245068,1444,,Come on.

1251050,1252425,1375,,I'm sorry. 
1252437,1253554,1117,Not that six. ,
1253962,1255972,2010,,Not that six.
1260259,1261619,1360,,Come on.
