636234,637109,875,And six yeah. ,
637948,638934,986,,I think I'm going to do it. 
639246,642741,3495,Yeah now it's just two more obstacles. ,
643362,644814,1452,,This is like.

650980,653586,2606,"Two, yeah that does it. ",
653692,654908,1216,,Slowly but surely. 
656155,658058,1903,yeah now it's just one more. ,
660374,662877,2503,That's actually the best spot to be in. ,
663128,663534,406,,Is it?
663988,666919,2931,Yeah as long as you don't hit a one you win. ,
666919,670258,3339,,"Yeah, that's true. "
671339,672373,1034,,Yes.

678417,682931,4514,We can do one more. I think we should have a deciding game right?,
682931,684844,1913,,Yeah that sounds fair. 
686258,688303,2045,,Sounds reasonable. 
688805,689935,1130,Double five. ,
691494,693106,1612,,This is perfect right?
693348,695355,2007,Yeah wow. ,
695826,696844,1018,Now you are speed running. ,
697294,699054,1760,,Yeah this is a speed run. 
703852,708299,4447,"Yeah, no ladders but no snakes. ",
708721,714291,5570,,I wonder if they would consider using this game in awesome games done quick. 
715793,718827,3034,Right for a actual speed run.,
718827,719474,647,,Yeah. 
721820,726948,5128,Yeah what would be the strategy to speed run this game. ,
726948,728525,1577,,I'm not quite sure. 
731189,734965,3776,,Roll fast or roll slow. Those are the two options I think. 
735206,740034,4828,Yeah you are probably right. There's not so much to control. ,
744193,745760,1567,Oh no. ,
746148,748024,1876,I'm back to the first row. ,
748096,749396,1300,,Wait is this good or bad?
749999,750775,776,It was good. ,
754993,757123,2130,,But this game is far from over. 
757252,759351,2099,Yes anything can happen. ,
759863,761314,1451,,Anything can happen. 
769943,774896,4953,But I feel like you're definitely in a better position than I am. ,
775005,777167,2162,,Slightly better position I would say.
777732,778496,764,Oh no. ,
778595,779314,719,,Back to one. 
779828,780888,1060,Back to one. ,
781042,782045,1003,,Okay.
784586,785431,845,Nice. ,
787851,789903,2052,Yeah now you are playing with ladders. ,
789937,793293,3356,,Yeah I feel like I've lucked out. 
794047,795755,1708,,But I'm sure I'm going to hit eightyseven. 
796493,798526,2033,Yeah that's a bad one. ,
801754,804840,3086,Lets see how long your luck can remain. ,
806840,807804,964,Wow. ,
809276,810718,1442,,Literally perfect. 
811611,812162,551,Yeah. ,
812362,813101,739,,Come on come on. 
814057,814752,695,,Yes.
815702,816571,869,Okay. ,
816704,821827,5123,,But this happened the last time for you. And then you ended up at eightyseven I remember. 
824812,827833,3021,Yeah the nintyeight is tough. ,
828712,829584,872,,"Wow, god man. "
829619,831538,1919,I'm getting nowhere. I'm stuck. ,
837300,838695,1395,,Okay here goes. 
841770,844931,3161,,"No, fuck. "
846433,850189,3756,Yeah that's the last snake and you hit it. ,
850189,851125,936,,Yes. 
854044,854857,813,That's too bad. ,
854896,856310,1414,,I'm still in a decent spot I think.
858751,861241,2490,"Again, back to one. ",
861241,863347,2106,,Back to square one literally. 
864827,866241,1414,At least I get a six. ,
866880,867718,838,Take a shortcut. ,
867897,868591,694,,Yeah. 
875362,876614,1252,Though I was going to hit the ladder. ,
876737,878111,1374,,Yeah almost. 
879442,883026,3584,Going in between ladders. That's bad luck. ,
883121,884433,1312,,That's what it is. 
889092,893482,4390,You've hit at least one snake this game right?,
893482,894620,1138,,Yeah I think I've hit one. 
894790,896877,2087,,No. 
898037,899096,1059,,Fucking knew it. 
901241,903716,2475,Yeah that's one of the two worst.,
906902,909574,2672,You are making backwards progress. ,
909574,910205,631,,Yeah. 
916896,920422,3526,I feel like I'm hitting every snake on the way up. ,
920477,920890,413,,Yeah. 
922955,925163,2208,,But now I've hit the same snake twice. 
927174,930258,3084,,"yes, come on. Sixtynine baby. "
930480,935209,4729,That ladder may seem short but it's actually really good. ,
935209,935790,581,,Yeah.
935897,937982,2085,You are skipping nineteen squares.,
937982,939021,1039,,That's true.
