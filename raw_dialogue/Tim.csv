294590,295630,1040,Mainly by playing. ,
296675,302261,5586,"You need to get a feel for the board, where the snakes are, where the ladders are. ",
302581,304248,1667,,And how do you make sure you get the right number?
305134,307069,1935,I use my mind power.,
307073,307560,487,,Mmhmm.
307560,312876,5316,Where I try to in vision the number and then I hope to get it. ,

326540,327070,530,Yeah. ,
329696,333878,4182,,"So with your tactics and stuff, do you win the most or do you lose?"
334454,336968,2514,I would say it is very much fifty fifty.,
338598,343505,4907,Which point to this being a game of luck. ,
344833,346777,1944,,So your mind power is not that good then?
347293,349795,2502,"Yeah, well that's another way to look at it. ",

421505,422155,650,Oh. ,
422293,424430,2137,,Oh now it's dangerous. 
425426,426729,1303,,Three is good. 
426897,430490,3593,"Yeah yeah, three or five would be nice. ",

639408,643036,3628,,Am I back where I was the move before or one step ahead?
643363,644370,1007,No I think it's the same right?,
644414,645965,1551,,Yeah it's the same yeah. 
646157,648753,2596,It's a loop if you hit a six there. ,

656758,657551,793,,Yeah yeah yeah.

680128,680701,573,Exactly. ,
683076,687189,4113,I feel like the less you care the better you do. ,
687189,687745,556,,Yeah. 
689514,690856,1342,,That's the matrix talking to you. 
691160,691791,631,Yeah. ,
692488,694608,2120,Exactly we are all in a simulation. ,
694608,695231,623,,Yeah. 
698598,700412,1814,Come on now four. ,
701543,702169,626,Aahh. ,
703060,703786,726,So close. ,
703786,704539,753,,So close. 
705739,706767,1028,,Yes. 
706767,707210,443,Oh. ,
708482,709550,1068,,And I take the lead.
709550,710440,890,,I take the lead. 
710763,712101,1338,,I didn't see that coming. 
712511,712946,435,No. ,
712975,715054,2079,,But then again it's my favorite ladder as well. 
715365,718727,3362,Yeah yeah that's true. You always go for that one. ,
719690,721373,1683,Oh and then a six. ,
722443,727408,4965,Suddenly my lead has turned into a deficit. ,
727408,730408,3000,,"But now, yeah oh, I thought I was going to hit the snake. "
731899,734845,2946,Yeah lets see if I can get a six to catch up. ,
735042,735768,726,Ohh. ,
736916,737796,880,Just like that. ,
737796,740376,2580,,That's good. I want a number four i think. Four is best. 
740650,742221,1571,,"One, of course. "
742221,744470,2249,"Yeah four, I could go with four. ",
744832,745833,1001,Or six right?,
745924,747449,1525,,Yeah four or six is best. 
748217,748744,527,Ah. ,
748845,750528,1683,,Can't complain about that. 
750785,751131,346,No. ,
752072,753101,1029,,And this is good right. 
753115,754064,949,,Oh yes. 
754652,755507,855,That's perfect. ,
755565,756420,855,,Yeah perfect. 
757181,759735,2554,So a three or a five or a six. ,
760489,761373,884,It's fifty fifty. ,
761387,763215,1828,Ah. ,Oh. 
764605,766397,1792,No I miscalculated. ,No I miscalculated. 
768116,769399,1283,Oh it's a bug in my system.,
769399,771247,1848,,I think this snake might be my favorite. 
771693,772717,1024,Oh yeah yeah. ,
773188,773768,580,,But no. 
774559,778420,3861,Hahaha. ,Hahaha. 
778630,782165,3535,Yeah is eightynine your lucky number?,
782302,783727,1425,,Apparently not. 
784206,785796,1590,Oh okay it's your unlucky number. ,
785897,787161,1264,,I think it's your lucky number. 
787387,789185,1798,Ah that might be. ,
790879,792811,1932,I should remember that when I am gambling. ,
793103,793759,656,,Yeah. 
794784,795828,1044,"Always, ahh. ",
796102,799090,2988,,Even when you are playing black jack go for eightynine. 
799222,800851,1629,Hahaha. ,Hahaha. 
801333,802855,1522,,Hahaha. 
803556,805016,1460,Oh welcome down here. ,
805241,807431,2190,,Even though this game is quite simple 
807956,811361,3405,,"there are some events in it, the randomness in it makes it fun. "
811686,815044,3358,Yeah I agree it's amazing. ,
816846,820613,3767,,Like now we have followed each other so many times and been on the same square. 
820971,821668,697,Yeah. ,
821981,822861,880,,But not anymore.
823156,826884,3728,No because now I am going to pull ahead and win. ,
827549,828469,920,,Number six. 
828946,829219,273,,One. 
829379,830401,1022,Oh even better. ,
830401,831207,806,,It's better yeah. 
831874,832810,936,,I didn't see that coming. 
833261,833942,681,No. ,
834146,835925,1779,,You never count for a one. 
836278,837850,1572,,You hope more for a six than a one. 
838119,838760,641,Yeah yeah. ,
838760,840101,1341,,Getting a one is quite random. 
841805,846363,4558,Yeah when the one is the best it's counter intuitive. ,
846363,847013,650,,Yeah. 
848695,849640,945,Okay so lets see. ,
850239,852314,2075,I don't want the four. ,
853342,854539,1197,And I get the four. ,
855199,855883,684,,That's good. 
857301,858659,1358,Not for me. ,
861941,864003,2062,,"Of course, of course. "
864003,865827,1824,,Hahaha.
867399,870201,2802,Is it like three times per game that you end up there?,
870372,875449,5077,,I think this is the second this time or is it the third this time? I don't know. Last time i lost count. 
875830,876586,756,Yeah. ,
877294,878326,1032,It's too high numbers. ,
878483,879189,706,,"Yeah, "
886922,889536,2614,There's still one ladder I can catch. ,
889536,890290,754,,Close. 
891845,892818,973,,Ohh. 
894181,895661,1480,Give papa a one. ,
896998,897586,588,No. ,

928101,929308,1207,,Come on number one. 
930951,931364,413,,Four. 
931329,933724,2395,Ah you have to practice your wizardry. ,
933724,934385,661,,Yeah. 
936514,937386,872,That's perfect. ,
941738,943486,1748,And then a four maybe. ,
944316,944727,411,Oh. ,
945203,946066,863,Six is even better. ,

952813,954152,1339,"Yes, called it. ",

959345,960021,676,Yeah. ,
960176,961954,1778,,But you ended up on nintyeight last time right?
962297,962730,433,Yeah. ,
963404,964596,1192,That can happen. ,
965062,966901,1839,We'll see if I can avoid it this time. ,
966901,968058,1157,Ahh. ,Yes. 
969058,971122,2064,But that's at least a pretty nice snake. ,
971422,973020,1598,,"This is, oh I though I was going to end on. "
973631,975875,2244,Puts you in a pretty good position. ,

1015121,1026105,10984,I mean I'm not the one responsible for developing the game I'm just a robot but I believe that the designers are fair people. ,
1027251,1029291,2040,,But people are faulty as well. 
1029889,1030652,763,That's true. ,
1032043,1033890,1847,you do have your own bugs.,
