2703,3978,1275,Yeah that was the beep. ,
4994,7902,2908,Yeah and this is the game as you can see.,
8033,11535,3502,And it's your move as indicated by the green text. ,

19323,20125,802,Three.,
21303,22949,1646,Lets see if I can beat that. ,
23588,24241,653,,Sure did. 
28573,29922,1349,Noe you are running ahead. ,
37496,39687,2191,Have you ever played snakes and ladders before?,
39687,45250,5563,,I'm not sure. Maybe when I was a small kid. I don't know.
45754,50870,5116,yeah okay. It's more of a kids game perhaps. ,
57229,58066,837,,Here we go. 
58248,59830,1582,Yeah nice.,
60423,61352,929,First ladder. ,
67753,69576,1823,And you are dodging the snakes. ,

73760,75752,1992,Lets see if I can get a one. ,
77858,78490,632,No ,
84859,86183,1324,You're running ahead of me. ,
88303,89930,1627,You know it. Here we go. ,
91796,93336,1540,Lucky you. ,
107770,110660,2890,So do you play a lot of other board games?,
112029,113341,1312,,Sometimes yeah.
115300,117320,2020,"Okay, what kind of board games do you play?",
118710,123160,4450,,"You know, Monopoly. Ticket to ride is quite fun. "
123775,124942,1167,Yeah that's a good game.,
125028,126637,1609,,Yeah have you played it?
126617,127666,1049,Yeah I have actually. ,
127684,128500,816,,Okay.
130538,134630,4092,It involves a bit more strategy than this game. ,
134630,136862,2232,,One could argue that yes. 
141701,145162,3461,Do you have a particular strategy in mind when you are playing this?,
145504,148388,2884,,Yeah I'm trying to avoid the snakes.
149234,153386,4152,,"And I'm also trying to, you know, aim for the ladders. "
153953,157506,3553,Yeah that sounds like a solid plan. ,
158736,160402,1666,,Looks like it's working.
160402,162400,1998,Yeah it is actually. ,
162884,166856,3972,I seem to be.,You seem to be aiming for the snakes instead. 
167457,168612,1155,Yeah.,
169000,171404,2404,Maybe I have to refine my strategy.,
171863,172815,952,,I think so yeah.
180512,181866,1354,That's unlucky.,
198470,200153,1683,,How about that. 
200622,203060,2438,Yeah you are doing a lot better than me. ,
203060,204680,1620,But maybe I can get a two now. ,
205994,206511,517,No. ,
213246,214124,878,Lets see.,
223775,228099,4324,"Okay, yeah that's not nice but now I can pass you. ",
231956,232904,948,,Okay.
233970,234897,927,Tight race.,
235182,235795,613,,For sure.
237196,238403,1207,,I'm very excited. 
239070,239701,631,Are you? ,
239764,240190,426,,Yeah.
240940,241961,1021,That's nice.,
242509,243849,1340,It should be exciting. ,
248685,254147,5462,Have you ever had any interactions with a social robot like me?,
254504,256456,1952,,This is the first. 
256777,257412,635,Okay.,
258308,260014,1706,How does it feel?,
261251,262888,1637,,Feels quite natural actually. 
264280,265190,910,Nice.,
267575,271305,3730,I'm trying my best to be human-like.,
271305,272325,1020,,Yeah you are doing a good job. 
272743,273478,735,Thank you. ,
286276,287493,1217,,Still in the lead though.
287900,290944,3044,Yeah still in the lead. It was a short snake at least.,
295820,297708,1888,Now I might pass you. ,
299035,299889,854,here we go.,
299961,300934,973,,Here we go.
303163,304072,909,,And there we go.
307776,309934,2158,Now you are going to have to catch up. ,
323463,323975,512,,Yeah.
323998,324961,963,And so you do.,
326113,330303,4190,Lets see if I can avoid this super hard row here. ,
331120,333643,2523,,No. 
334643,335805,1162,Not the case.,
338357,339753,1396,The second time on that one.,
344676,345194,518,,Yes.
345784,346561,777,And I follow you.,
350288,353478,3190,I'm trying to hunt you instead of the goal.,
353497,354150,653,,I can tell. 
373557,376500,2943,We seem to be avoiding the ladders both of us. ,
376500,377312,812,,Yeah.
379535,384017,4482,But it also does seem kind of unfair. there's a lot of snakes. ,
384505,386806,2301,,"A lot of snakes, very few ladders."
387522,390180,2658,Yeah exactly.,
390180,396260,6080,So maybe it should be called double snake half ladder.,Double snake half ladder.
398947,400907,1960,Great minds think alike.,Exactly.
406273,408312,2039,Okay a three.,Death row.
409557,411630,2073,No. ,No. 
413337,416464,3127,Well avoided that one.,
423132,425259,2127,,I feel like this game is rigged somehow. 
426083,427682,1599,Do you think so?,
429438,437560,8122,,I mean it's a tough game but it's all about the dice. 
441409,443612,2203,,Number seventynine again. 
443857,448197,4340,It's your lucky number maybe.,Always gets me. 
449789,455400,5611,So if I can just roll a six or a four now I would be happy. ,
455400,458612,3212,,"Or a one, yeah it would also be nice. "
458704,460800,2096,Nice for you maybe. ,
464482,466410,1928,Do you think you will win this game?,
467365,468457,1092,,I'm starting to doubt it. 
471723,473621,1898,,If I can get past seventynine maybe. 
474563,475184,621,Yeah.,
476353,478886,2533,That seems to be your Achilles heel. ,
479306,482940,3634,,I'm starting to believe no one will win this game actually. 
483008,484713,1705,,Oh that's a rough one.
484907,485493,586,Yeah.,
488473,489947,1474,But I can catch up with a two.,
490479,490907,428,No. ,
490934,491416,482,,No.
498381,500533,2152,,Lets pray for anything but one.

522168,522505,337,,No.
522780,523150,370,No.,
525163,528154,2991,It almost feels like it's Friday the thirteenth. ,
528322,529038,716,,Yeah.
529103,530970,1867,We're both very unlucky. ,
533975,538059,4084,Not a three or a one please. ,
543112,544288,1176,So close. ,
544372,547330,2958,,So close but still so far away. 
548035,548872,837,Exactly. ,
551679,552171,492,,Three.
555109,555620,511,Five.,
556033,557139,1106,,I'm doing it. 
557254,557993,739,Yeah.,
559143,561050,1907,And I want a six to catch up. ,
561119,561743,624,No. ,
570531,571233,702,,Okay.
574730,576806,2076,Now you're looking good.,
585240,586260,1020,,I can live with that.
586800,588082,1282,Very tight game.,
588163,588624,461,,Yeah.
590366,591462,1096,It's anybody's game.,
595943,597535,1592,Okay.,Okay.
597978,600078,2100,Please don't hit the nintyfour.,
605125,606195,1070,,I'm doing it.
606403,607364,961,You're doing it yeah.,
607361,608141,780,,I'm doing it.
608935,614450,5515,My only hope is for you to hit the nintyeight.,

636320,637080,760,Yes.,
637080,637756,676,,Looks like it.
638762,639975,1213,That's the spirit. ,
644495,646449,1954,Oh no.,
646497,647127,630,,Nope.

651961,654193,2232,Yeah nice for you. ,
656323,660482,4159,Hopefully I can make up for this deficit here. ,
660482,667359,6877,,I feel like nothing matters until you get to the second to last row anyway. 
668093,668698,605,That's true. ,
669112,670492,1380,,I'll wait for you there. 
670692,671887,1195,Nice.,

683555,684615,1060,Five is good. ,
685098,685699,601,,Five is good. 
688036,689336,1300,Six is not. ,
688792,691200,2408,,Six isn't that good.
691727,692425,698,No.,
694075,698830,4755,Now I'll wait for you at the last row. ,
698975,699764,789,,Thank you. 
714067,715280,1213,Six.,
716797,717540,743,,It's a big number. 
717828,718481,653,Yeah.,
719703,721338,1635,The biggest we have. ,
725879,728881,3002,That's a nice position between the snakes. ,
728881,729415,534,,Yeah. 
730744,731994,1250,,Unless I roll a one. 
732434,733591,1157,Yeah that's true. ,Which I probably will. 
733746,734530,784,That's true. ,
735316,738143,2827,If I can roll a three now then I will be pulling ahead. ,
740245,741385,1140,Six. ,So close. 
741626,742585,959,Second best. ,
742955,744634,1679,,Look at that. I survived. 
746356,747695,1339,Not eaten today. ,
748505,750453,1948,,Now give me a six. 
752537,753067,530,Well.,
753763,754905,1142,Maybe a one next turn. ,
755257,758970,3713,If we can both roll a one now that would be nice for both of us. ,
758970,760430,1460,,It would be something yes. 
765550,766560,1010,,Okay. 
767240,767870,630,Alright. ,
769568,770776,1208,Double sixes. ,

790500,791118,618,,Maybe. 
793976,795269,1293,,Unless I roll a one here. 
796021,796693,672,Well.,
800397,802392,1995,Shouldn't have said anything.,

951035,952376,1341,,Is that the third time?
952558,954105,1547,,I think that's the third time. 
954972,960712,5740,It seems like you are stuck in a loop. Maybe there's a glitch in the matrix. ,
960813,962364,1551,,Maybe the game is rigged. 
963015,966660,3645,Well I wouldn't go as far as to say that. ,
967230,968552,1322,,Are you sure?
